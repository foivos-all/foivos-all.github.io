I'm Fivos Allagiotis, an AI/ML Software Engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I specialize in building agentic systems for secure code generation and vulnerability detection, combining deep expertise in LLMs, RAG, and ML engineering to ship production-ready AI tools. My background spans machine learning research in 5G networks, large-scale data science, fraud detection, and cybersecurity, with degrees from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Patras. When I'm not coding, you'll find me on the tennis court or experimenting in the kitchen.
